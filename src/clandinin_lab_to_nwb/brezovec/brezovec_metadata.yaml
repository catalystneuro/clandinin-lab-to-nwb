  surgery: "Each fly was anesthetized on a chilled Peltier plate with a thermally coupled custom holder. Each immobilized fly was carefully fitted into a custom mount consisting of 3D-printed plastic and a custom cut steel shim to tightly nestle the head and thorax. To fix the fly to the mount, UV-curable glue was placed and cured on the dorsal region of the face between the eyes, and on the thorax. A saline solution was added to the dish for dissection (103 mM NaCl, 3 mM KCl, 5 mM TES, 1 mM NaH2PO4, 4 mM MgCl2, 1.5 mM CaCl2, 10 mM trehalose, 10 mM glucose, 7 mM sucrose, and 26 mM NaHCO3). Using a tungsten needle the posterior head cuticle was carefully cut and removed to reveal the whole brain (Figure S1). Dissection forceps were used to remove fat and trachea."

  session_description:
    We use volumetric two-photon imaging to map neural activity associated with walking across the entire brain of Drosophila. We detect locomotor signals in approximately 40% of the brain, identify a global signal associated with the transition from rest to walking, and define clustered neural signals selectively associated with changes in forward or angular velocity.

  description: "Flies were raised on molasses medium at 25 Â°C with a 12/12-h light/dark cycle. Flies were housed in mixed male/female vials of 10-20 individuals. 3-4 days post-eclosion females were used for imaging."
